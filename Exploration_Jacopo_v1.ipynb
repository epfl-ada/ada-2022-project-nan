    "- Exploration of metadata datasets\n",
    "- Attempts at parallization of the data loading and preprocessing\n",
    "- Creation of new datasets with the preprocessed data\n",
    "- Work on Tags:\n",
    "  - word embeddings with conceptnet 300d vectors on the first 1M tags\n",
    "  - creation of a new dataset with the embeddings of the tags as an np array, loads much faster and easy to work with\n",
    "  - dimensionality reduction for visualization with t-SNE -> 2D and 3D of the whole 1M and 100k tags (3d only on 100k as proof of concept)\n",
    "  - K-Means clustering with k=15 on the 100k 3D tags, interactive 3d Visualization with colors assigned to clusters\n",
    "  - Suggestions on next steps for tags and clustering, various groupings and possible weights"
