Way down in Italy’s sun-kissed south, visitors are only just beginning to notice the region’s charms, from its refreshingly rustic cuisine to its postcard beaches.\n\nPuglia’s food and wine credentials rival Tuscany’s, with acres of fertile countryside producing quality wines, cheeses and vegetables. Ingredients are fresh, locally grown and simple, but always delicious. Staples include orecchiette, little ear-shaped pasta traditionally handmade, and olive oil – the region grows olives in abundance, and is responsible for producing the largest quantities of Italian olive oil.\n\nAs one of Italy’s southernmost regions, you’ll find a fabulous Mediterranean climate and huge coastline to play with – the longest of any Italian region, in fact. Beaches range from rugged and rural, to white sands that wouldn’t look out of place in the Caribbean. You don’t have to venture far too find them; within half an hour of Lecce is the spectacular Salento peninsula, known for crystal-clear waters and peaceful shores.\n\nWhen it comes to Puglia’s cities, Lecce is the name on everyone’s lips. The so-called ‘Florence of the South’, this charming baroque city is home to one of Italy’s loveliest centro storicos (historic centres), crowned by a soaring cathedral and Roman amphitheatre. With an artisan shopping scene and hundreds of authentic restaurants, Lecce certainly has the culture and history to rival the Renaissance capital – just with a fraction of the crowds. The city of Ostuni, meanwhile, covers a hillside above the plains. Known as the ‘White City’, Ostuni’s characteristic whitewashed buildings weave up and down hills, through cobbled passageways and shady courtyards. Don’t leave Puglia without a trip to ‘trulli town’. Alberobello is one of the region’s most unique and characterful towns, filled with Puglia’s famous trulli houses. These little stone houses have cone-shaped roofs and cover Alberobello’s hillsides in their hundreds, resembling a picturesque toy town.\n\nFind out more about our holidays to Puglia: http://www.citalia.com/holidays/italy/puglia/","dislike_count":2,"display_id":"7Z50767qXkQ","duration":76,"like_count":96,"tags":"citalia,holiday,italy,italian,puglia,food,wine,olive oil,mediterranean,beach,beaches,salento,Lecce,Ostuni,trulli,alberabello","title":"Citalia Presents | Puglia","upload_date":"2017-08-24 00:00:00","view_count":4903}

Lying close to the mainland of Italy and just 90 miles from the African coastline, it retains Arab as well as Greek and Roman influences in its architecture and culture. Sicily is dominated by the dramatic landscapes around Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano and the highest mountain in Italy south of the Alps. An expedition to see it, or even climb it, is an essential part of any visit - and a sight to thrill the whole family.\n\nSicily's towns and cities are each unique. Palermo is a chaotic mix of crumbling villas, ancient churches and buzzing markets selling everything from seafood and fresh mozzarella, to vintage clothes and antiques, and where the atmosphere owes much to the souks of North Africa. Cefalù is a bustling seaside resort with a wide sandy beach and meandering cobbled streets with shops selling local crafts. Many visitors, however, spend their time in Taormina and it's easy to see why.

Originating in the Emilia-Romagna region, this rich and delicious sauce can be used for a variety of dishes.\n\nThere are many versions of this recipe but Gennaro Contaldo’s authentic recipe shows you how to make a simple and flavoursome sauce, using far fewer ingredients than you may have been expecting. You will see that instead of tins of tomatoes, for example, Gennaro uses a small amount of concentrated tomato puree, diluted in stock, making the sauce lovely and rich but not overly tomato-y. In fact, it is the good quality mince used in the recipe which is the star of the show.\n\nGennaro’s recipe is simple to make and as it is slow-cooked over a gentle heat for at least two hours, it is a relatively effortless recipe to pull together, allowing you to get on with other things as the house fills with the delicious smell of Italian cooking.\n\nGennaro’s top tip is to make more than you need and then freeze the excess in batches, ready to be used another time in a tagliatelle Bolognese or hearty lasagne.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIngredients\n4 x servings\n\n45ml extra virgin olive oil\n25g butter\n1 x onion, finely chopped\n1 x celery stalk, finely chopped\n1 x carrot, finely chopped\n150g pancetta, cubed\n200g minced beef\n200g minced pork\n200ml red wine\n2 x tablespoons double-concentrated tomato puree'\n200ml stock\n\nMethod\n\nHeat the extra virgin olive oil and butter in a pan, add the onion, celery, carrot and pancetta and sweat on a gentle heat for about 10 minutes until the onion has softened.

What makes it so versatile is the fact that it can be made well in advance and baked when required – perfect for stress free hosting!\n\nAn authentic lasagne is made with the famous ragu Bolognese and egg pasta sheets typical of the Emilia-Romagna region, although dried pasta sheets can be used instead thanks to their ready availability.\n\nLayers are built up using the pasta sheets, ragu and béchamel (white) sauce, all topped with a final layer of the sauce and a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMethod\n\nIngredients\n4 x servings\n\nFor the Bolognese ragu – see recipe here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSIrBt6G5yQ\n\nFor the white sauce:\n40g butter\n40g plain flour\n500ml milk\nSalt & black pepper\n100g grated parmesan cheese\nAbout 8 x dried egg lasagne sheets\n\nMethod\nFirst make the Bolognese ragu - see recipe here (HYPERLINK)\nPreheat the oven to 200 degrees centigrade.\n\nMake the white sauce – melt the butter in a small pan on a medium heat, remove from the heat, stir in the flour with a small hand whisk (this will avoid lumps from forming) until you get a paste, stir in a little milk. Return to the heat, add the remaining milk and stirring all the time, cook on a medium heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from the heat, season with salt & pepper and stir in about a third of the grated parmesan.\n\nLine an ovenproof dish with a little of the Bolognese sauce, arrange sheets of lasagne over followed by more sauce, then a layer of white sauce, sprinkle some grated parmesan and continue making layers like this until you have used up all the ingredients ending with a topping of white sauce and grated parmesan cheese.\n\nBake in the hot oven for about 30 - 35 minutes until golden-brown.  Remove, leave to rest for a couple of minutes and serve.","dislike_count":156,"display_id":"y2SVA6EsrTE","duration":363,"like_count":7867,"tags":"Gennaro Contaldo,Italy,Lasagne,Pasta,Recipe,Chef,Mince,Beef,How To Make Lasagna,Lasagna,Lasagna Recipe,Lasagne Recipe,Homemade Lasagna","title":"Gennaro Contaldo's Authentic Italian Lasagne | Citalia","upload_date":"2016-04-27 00:00:00","view_count":582615}

At over four times the size of Capri, Ischia offers plenty of opportunities to escape the crowds and unwind; from beaches and hot springs, to quiet fishing villages and mountain-top osterias.\n\nOne of the most iconic sights and tourist attractions of Ischia is the Castello Aragonese which has stood for nearly three centuries. Whether you view it from the shoreline at sunrise or brave the steps to the top and look back towards Ischia Ponte, this breathtaking landmark is a must see.\n\nAlternatively, you could choose to take in panoramic vistas from Ischia’s highest mountain, Mount Epomeo which peaks at 788 meters above sea level or visit Sant’Angelo, a beautiful little fishing village with a quaint, unspoilt vibe and a choice of beaches just a short stroll from the harbour.\n\nIf you’re looking to unwind and relax whilst on Ischia, you have a choice of several thermal parks, gardens and spas where you can spend the day soaking away any aches or pains.\n\nWhether you choose to visit Capri or Ischia individually or visit them both, you’re sure to be spoilt for choice when it comes to dining. With both islands offering a wide selection of cafes and restaurant providing traditional, authentic Italian flavours and more contemporary choices alike, Ischia and Capri provide a treat for all the senses.\n\n\nFor More information about Capri, visit : http://www.citalia.com/luxury/Capri\n\nFor More information about Ischia, visit : http://www.citalia.com/luxury/Ischia","dislike_count":5,"display_id":"QbT3Effiz5E","duration":207,"like_count":113,"tags":"Italy,Italian,Ischia,Capri,Boat Tour,Cruise,Shopping,Fashion,Food,Wine,Holiday,Luxury,Designer,Nature,Bay of Naples,Views,Stunning,Beautiful,Style,Sophistication,Break,Vacation,Restaurants,Grotta Azzura,Tyrrhenian,Osterias,Castello Aragonese,Ischia Ponte,Mount Epomeo,Sant'Angelo","title":"Citalia Presents | Italian Islands Ischia & Capri","upload_date":"2016-03-21 00:00:00","view_count":14507}

As with many of Italy's holidays, food plays an integral part in the Easter celebrations.\n\nHere, chef Gennaro Contaldo shows you how to make a delicious roast leg of lamb with spring peas and baby onions - the perfect centre-piece for your Easter lunch this year, particularly if served on a large platter with the peas and sweet onions tumbling down around the meat. Your Easter lunch is a great opportunity to celebrate the produce of the spring season and Gennaro’s leg of lamb recipe is the perfect way to showcase these lovely fresh flavours.\n\nTo ensure maximum flavour enters the meat, Gennaro scores the leg of lamb and rubs in olive oil, salt and pepper before adding black olives and chopped anchovies before cooking. Anchovies may seem like a surprising addition to a lamb dish but instead of tasting fish, you simply get a deep, salty flavour which complements the lamb - delicious!\n\nLooking for an authentic pudding to round off your Easter feast?

Watch the video to find out how to make zuccotto at home.\n\n\nIngredients\n6 – 8 x servings\n\n1kg ricotta\n140g caster sugar\n70g candied fruit, finely chopped\n50g flaked almonds\n50g chocolate chips\n1 tablespoon cocoa powder\n600g Panettone, cut into 2 round discs and the rest into slices lengthways 2.5cm thick\n170ml Vin Santo\nCocoa powder for dusting\nOrange zest to decorate\n\n1 x pudding basin or bowl approximately 15cm in diameter\nCling film\n\nMethod\n\nIn a bowl, mix half the ricotta with 70g of sugar until creamy, fold in 35g of candied fruit, 25g of flaked almonds and 25g of chocolate chips until all well amalgamated.

Line with the slices of panettone and with the help of a pastry brush, brush about three quarters of the Vin Santo on the cake slices.\n\n\n\n\nFill with the white ricotta mixture which should fill half the pudding basin. Take one of the round panettone discs and place over the top pressing gently and drizzle with some of the Vin Santo. Fill with the chocolate ricotta mixture and cover with the other panettone disc, drizzling with the remaining Vin Santo.\n\nBring up the overhang of cling film and place a weight on top - I use a couple of heavy plates. Place in the fridge for at least six hours or overnight.\n\n\n\n\nRemove from the fridge and take off both the weight and the cling film over the top. Turn upside-down on a plate.

In a large heavy-based frying pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil. When hot, add the floured chicken chunks and seal well on all sides for a couple of minutes until golden-brown and quite crisp.\n\nReduce the heat to medium, add the garlic and rosemary, cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes, turning the chicken from time to time. Raise the heat to high, remove the lid, add the wine and simmer until it has evaporated.\n\nCheck the chicken is cooked; the flesh should come easily away from the bone and there should be no sign of pink when you pierce the thickest part. Skim off the oil from the top and set aside.\n\nFor the bruschetta, toast some slices of bread, immediately rub them with the garlic and then drizzle with some of the reserved olive oil.

Gennaro Contaldo shows you how to make his delicious vegetarian risotto in this easy to follow video. Enjoy!\n\nIngredients\n• 2 x courgettes\n• 100g asparagus\n• 4 tablespoons olive oil\n• 1 x small onion, very finely chopped\n• ½ stalk celery, very finely chopped\n• 350g arborio rice\n• 100g fresh peas, clean weight\n• 100g fresh broad beans, clean weight\n• ½ glass white wine\n• 1.5 litres vegetable stock, kept gently simmering in a pan\n• 25g butter\n• 25g parmesan cheese, freshly grated\n\nMethod\nFirst prepare the courgettes. Wash well and trim the ends. With a small sharp knife, cut strips lengthways of the green part and chop very finely. Discard the white middle bit (you can keep for your vegetable stocks). Then prepare the asparagus. Discard the hard part of the asparagus, finely chop the rest keeping aside the tips.\n\nHeat the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and celery and sweat on a gentle heat. Add the rice and stir well coating each grain with the oil ensuring you don't burn the rice so keep on a gentle heat and keep stirring. You will notice the rice granules become shiny. At this stage, add the white wine, keep stirring until the wine evaporates. Then add the peas, broad beans, courgettes and asparagus (not the tips), mix well, always ensuring that the vegetables do not stick.\n\nAdd a couple of ladlefuls of stock and keep stirring until the liquid evaporates. Then add more stock and continue to do so for about 20/25 minutes. About 5 minutes before the end of cooking time, add the asparagus tips. Remove from the heat, beat in the butter and parmesan.\n\nLeave to rest for a minute and serve immediately.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn more about our partnership with Gennaro Contaldo: http://bit.ly/GennaroCitalia\n\nClick this link to Subscribe to our channel so you don't miss anything that Gennaro has in store for you: http://bit.ly/CitaliaYouTube\n\nPlease visit http://bit.ly/Citalia if you are thinking about planning your next Italian getaway\n\nFollow Citalia Holidays on:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/citaliaholidays\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/citalia_holidays\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/citalia_holiday","dislike_count":13,"display_id":"JjtPKmz-Ses","duration":470,"like_count":1042,"tags":"Vegetable Risotto,Risotto (Dish),Gennaro Contaldo Recipes,Risotto Recipes,Vegetable Risotto Recipe,Spring Vegetable Risotto,Vegetarian Risotto,How to Make Risotto,Risotto Recipe,vegetarian risotto recipe,Gennaro Contaldo (Chef),Cooking (Interest),Recipe (Website Category)","title":"Gennaro Contaldo's Spring Vegetable Risotto Recipe | Citalia","upload_date":"2015-04-29 00:00:00","view_count":75455}

This ricotta and lemon tart is a sort of Italian take on the French tarte au citron but with an added twist. Definitely give this fun Italian dessert a try.\n\nIt is believed that this dessert dates back to pagan times when ancient Neapolitans would offer all the fruits of their land to the Mermaid Partenope in spring  -  eggs for fertility, wheat from the land, ricotta from the shepherds, the aroma of orange flowers, vanilla to symbolise faraway countries and sugar in honour of the sweet mermaid. It is said the mermaid would take all these ingredients, immerse herself in the sea of the Bay of Naples and give back to the Neapolitans a dessert, which symbolised fertility and rebirth in Greek mythology.  The recipe as we know it today was realised by Neapolitan convents and nuns would make it for rich nobles of the area.\n\nIt is traditionally made at Easter and I always remember my mum and aunts making it. It is still made at home today, as well as bought in pastry shops throughout the Campania region.  In Naples, Easter wouldn’t be Easter without a Pastiera di Grano, however, it is delicious to eat at any time. Wheat sounds a strange ingredient, but it really is delicious, especially with the delicate flavour of orange-flower water. Precooked wheat is obtainable from Italian delis and orange-flower water can nowadays be found in supermarkets.\n\nIngredients\nMakes 1 x 10 inch round shallow cake tin\n\nFor the sweet shortcrust pastry :\n400g Italian plain flour\n3 x eggs\n100g caster sugar\n150g butter, at room temperature, diced\nGrated zest of 1 lemon\n\nFor the filling :\n1 x 400g tin of precooked wheat\n125ml milk\n1 x tablespoon lemon zest\n½ x teaspoon vanilla essence\n250g ricotta\n5 x egg yolks\n200g icing sugar\n2 x egg whites\n120g mixed candied peel\n1.5 x tablespoons orange-flower water\n½ x lemon zest\n½ x orange zest\n\nSieved icing sugar, to sprinkle over the top\n\nMethod\n\nMake the pastry. Sift the flour onto a work surface and make a well in the centre. Add the eggs, sugar, butter and half the lemon zest (reserve the rest for the filling) and lightly blend everything together with your fingertips until you have a smooth dough. Wrap in clingfilm, chill for 1 hour, then roll out thinly and use to line a 25 cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Place in the fridge until ready to use. Do not discard the pastry trimmings  -  shape them into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge.\n\nPreheat the oven to 170 degrees centigrade.\n\nPlace the wheat, milk, 1 tablespoon lemon zest and vanilla essence in a small saucepan.  Mix well together and bring to the boil.  Reduce the heat and gently simmer until the wheat has absorbed all the liquid. Then leave to cool.\n\nMash the ricotta with a fork and beat in the egg yolk until you get a light and fluffy consistency.  Beat in the icing sugar until well incorporated followed by the candied peel, orange-flower water, lemon zest and orange zest. Stir in the cooled wheat mixture.\n\nWhisk the egg whites until stiff.  Then fold into the mixture and mix gently together until all the ingredients are well incorporated.  Remove the pastry case from the fridge and pour in the mixture.\n\nWith the remaining pastry, roll out quite thinly and cut out 1 inch strips roughly the size of the cake tin.  Arrange the strips criss-cross over the top roughly 1 inch, trimming any excess pastry and pressing the edges against the lined pastry.\n\nBake in the oven for 50 minutes.  Leave to cool, then sprinkle with sieved icing sugar, slice and serve.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn more about our partnership with Gennaro Contaldo: http://bit.ly/GennaroCitalia\n\nClick this link to Subscribe to our channel so you don't miss anything that Gennaro has in store for you: http://bit.ly/CitaliaYouTube\n\nPlease visit http://bit.ly/Citalia if you are thinking about planning your next Italian getaway\n\nFollow Citalia Holidays on:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/citaliaholidays\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/citalia_holidays\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/citalia_holiday","dislike_count":7,"display_id":"Xn3pbqC6f14","duration":469,"like_count":670,"tags":"Ricotta (Cheese),Sweet Ricotta Tart,Ricotta Recipes,Italian Desserts,Tart Recipes,Tarts,Lemon Tart,Pastry Recipe,Gennaro Contaldo (Chef),Tart (Dish),Dessert (Industry),Italian Food (Industry),Neapolitan Cuisine (Cuisine)","title":"Gennaro Contaldo's Neapolitan Wheat & Ricotta Easter Tart Recipe | Citalia","upload_date":"2015-03-17 00:00:00","view_count":80422}

This vegetable is very popular in Southern Italy during the winter and often simply sauteed in olive oil, garlic and chilli.  In Puglia, this vegetable is served with traditional handmade orecchiette pasta, shaped like little ears. Orecchiette are now becoming widely available in good delis and supermarkets outside of Italy. If you can't find cime di rapa, substitute with purple sprouting or long stem broccoli. Scroll down for the full recipe.\n\nIngredients:\n4 x servings\n\n360g dried or fresh orecchiette pasta\nSalt\n500g turnip tops, clean weight, leaves only, discard stalks\n120ml extra virgin olive oil & extra for drizzling\n3 x garlic cloves sliced\n1 x red chilli, finely chopped\nFreshly grated pecorino cheese\n\nMethod\n\nBring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the dried orecchiette for 15 minutes.  Halfway through, add the turnip tops.  If using fresh orecchiette, cook the turnip tops first, then add the pasta for the last three minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a frying pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil, add the garlic and chilli and sweat until the garlic is golden-brown, but not burned.  Discard the garlic and chilli. Drain the pasta and turnip tops and return to the pan with a little of the pasta water and mix well with the olive oil.

His Porchetta Natalizia recipe is great to make for large groups of people, can be made in advance and sliced when required. The traditional porchetta, a popular street food in the region of Rome, is seasoned with lots of herbs and cooked on a spit, sliced thickly and served as a substantial sandwich. Gennaro likes to use this porchetta recipe for special occasions like Xmas time when family comes to visit.  It also makes for an alternative Christmas lunch served with some roast potatoes. It is simple to prepare, slow-roasted in the oven, first at a high temperature and then much lower to cook the pork thoroughly through.\n\nINGREDIENTS  makes (4 - 6 servings):\n3 kg jacket of pork  (loin and belly boned)\nsalt & pepper\n70 ml Vin Santo\nzest of 2 x lemons\n2 x tablespoons EVO & extra for rubbing\n1 x onion, finely chopped\n175 gr pork mince\n175 gr chicken liver, finely chopped\n10 x sage leaves\n2 x rosemary sprigs\n2 x thyme sprigs\n350 gr bread, soaked in lukewarm water,\n15 gr pine kernels\n30 gr sultanas\n6 slices mortadella\n4 x large carrots, sliced lengthways in half\n\nMETHOD :\nUnroll the jacket of pork and lay it flat on a board, sprinkle with salt and pepper and rub well in.  Drizzle the vin santo, sprinkle the lemon zest and massage well in.
